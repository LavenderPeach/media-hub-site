# media-hub-site

Creating a media hub website where users can review and discuss movies, television, books, and video games. The types of media will be divided into their own seperate areas, and users can get inter-media recommendations based on how they review certain works. Users can comment on titles and have their post seen by general users as well as those that are following them.
